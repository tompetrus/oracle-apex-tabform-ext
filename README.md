Oracle APEX - Tabular Form Namespace Extension

This javascript file will extend the apex.widget.tabular namespace with some new functions. 
The code is well-documented.
An example can be found here:
Note that 2 jQueryUI widgets are used on the example page, which I wrote myself. They are for demonstration purpose and are not critical to the working of the namespace extension.

Todo: provide a better write-up on the sample page and extract docs from js. Provide a space for the demo page on the demo app. Write a blog?
